This folder contains all of our single-vector data by county.  
It should include three rows: the county name, the state, and the data vector.  
Only contiguous 48 states should be used.  
All rows are to be sorted alphabetically by state, then sorted alphabetically by county.

Data we have and have not sorted:
* Poverty % 
* Population Density
* Age % by group
* Gender % by group
* Race % by Group
