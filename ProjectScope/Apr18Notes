#April 18th Notes

## The project: 
Create a model that will tell us "when can States open for business?"
Note: no model can actuallly answer that question, so we have to define our questions to the model carefully.

##  The steps: 
1.  our "y" output value is county-by-county deaths/1MM (or serious cases per 1MM)
2.  We will create our "X" matrix with county data
3.  We will use several different machine learning methods to match the X to the y.
4.  Choose the best method [Milestone 1]

5a. Incorporate transient data
5b. Identify nations that have "flattened the curve" as "Good Actors"
5c. Train transient model with Good Actors

6a. Improve the model with different parameters
6b. Retest other ML methods to determine best method for improved model
6c. Test improved model with Good Actors

7.  Incorporate the improved model with the transient model [Milestone 2]

8.  Test the transient improved model with Good Actors
9.  Apply transient improved model to states with varying quarantine level [Milestone 3]
