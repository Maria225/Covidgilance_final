This folder is where we should put all of the datasets we will use to create the model      

* By county data, preferably
* Simple data first, then we'll use more complicated data when we get good results
* 

Examples:  % smokers, % diabetes, sunlight, latitude, hospital rank, quarantine rating,
population density, mass transportation usage, # of tests, income, % poverty, median age
